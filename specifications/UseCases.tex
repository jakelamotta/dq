Description & The player fights an opponent, represented by another player in the game (or AI). & \\
Primary actor & Player whose turn it is & \\
Secondary actor & Player with previous turn. & \\
Precondition & None & \\
Trigger & A fight is initiated according to \ref{ambushopponent}. & \\ \hline
Basic flow & During the first round both players draw a random Power card (if the player unsuccessfully tried to flee, the power card used in the attempt can not be chosen) and add it to their hand. Both players draw cards from the combat deck, adding up to a total of five cards on their hands, without showing them to the other player. Note that each player has only one power card in each battle, and this card is to be regarded as a combat card. Each hero and monster have individual power cards.

Each turn in the battle goes as follows:

Both players choose a combat and place them infront of themselves. The cards are displayed when both players have selected their cards. If one or both cards are a power card, see Use case \ref{fight_powercard}.

If the player plays a card of a damage type that currently exists in the combat stack, and the played card has a higher attack value, then the player performs a death blow, see use case \ref{fight_deathblow}.

If the attack value of a player's Combat card is equal to or lower than the opponents attack value and his card has a counterattack icon matching the opponents attack type, the player may make a counterattack, see use case \ref{fight_counterattack}.

If both a death blow and a counterattack are possible on the same turn, first the death blow will occure, then the counterattack (if the loser survived the death blow).

The player with the highest total attack value wins the round (possibly due to the effects of a counterattack). The loser takes as much damage as the number of cards the winner used in the attack, and put their own cards in the combat stack. Both players draw new battle cards, to replenish those used in that round.

If the winner played a combat card of a type that is currently in the combat stack, additional damage is dealt according to \ref{fight_deathblow}.

If both players have the same attack value and no counterattacks are possible, no player wins and all cards are placed in the combat stack. This is called a Stand-off.

This is repeated, until either the opponent or the player has received damage higher than or equal to the available HP. In this case, the fight ends and game continues.

If the opponent was the winner, the player is out of the game and the monster continues to occupy the room, without taking any damage. If the player was the winner, the monster is dead.

The new tile must be oriented in such a way that a passage, door or portcullis is leading to the room the player has left. This also applies when the player moved through a hidden door.

If the room contains an opponent from a previous opponent, the player must first fight that opponent.

The player will then possibly be dealt a room card, depending on which type of room it is, or suffer other types of consequences, see table \ref{roomeffects}.

If the room contains a coffin or sarcophagus, the player may \emph{choose} to open the sarcophagus, see use case \ref{chests}. If the room contains a corpse or fallen warrior, the player may \emph{choose} to search the corpse/warrior, see use case \ref{corpse}.
